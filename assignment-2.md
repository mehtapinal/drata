Question: How would you prove that the world is flat?

 “Our auditors said so 😀 –-
Drata’s automation gathers evidence for compliance is – 

`select * from evidence where proves_world_is_flat = 'true';”`
    
" _Because I’m interviewing at Drata – hoping I've made you smile by now!_ 😂 "

But, on a more *serious* note – 
At my first glance, my initial thought process was – *NO!* Earth is not flat! How can I prove this? 
But then I re-read the question several times and what struck me was “world” and I thought `WORLD != EARTH` 

So here is my hypothesis…

If we consider the term "world" in a broader sense, we could potentially interpret it to mean the entire universe. 
We know Universe at a high level is…
- Infinite
- Contains various objects of all different sizes and shapes

Because of these above reasons, the entire world could possibly be a big flat surface where various planets and objects can oscillate.
