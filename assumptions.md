### Assumptions that I have considered for this assignment

- This high-level solution will not delve into the specific details of implementation, but rather focus on the overarching program and process.
    - Various stakeholders include (PMs,Eng leaders, Customer support, QA leaders and Technical support)
    - The details of the program will require further refinement in conjunction with these stakeholders.

- The current QA org has the right resources, budget and expertise to drive the proposed changes
- All the customer reported bugs are related to DRATA and known and agreed upon by stakeholders
- All stakeholders have acknowledged the current issue and are committed to finding innovative solutions to address it.

P.S: Each major section of my summary addresses DRATA's 4 core values 
- Built on Trust
- Act with Integrity
- Competitive Fire
- Customer Obsessive
